Hybrid Squares, Tournament Bracket Battle Weighted Lottery Game 

## Game Overview
Based on the NCAA Braketball Tournament Bracket selection and Football Squares contests, this contest assigns 64 college basketball teams to entrants via a weighted lottery. There are payoffs at four payoffs throughout the tournament. These are based on National Championship winner and farthest to advance seed classifications. The entrant therefore has a chance to win a payoff with a lower seeded team too.
